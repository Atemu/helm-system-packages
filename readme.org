#+TITLE: Helm-System-Packages

* Introduction

Helm-System-Packages is a Helm interface to the package manager of your operating system.

Start `helm-system-packages` to list all available packages (with installed packages displayed in their own face).
Fuzzy-search, mark and execute the desired action over any set of packages:

- Install
- Uninstall
- Display packages details or insert details at point
- Find files

Some package managers come with their specific actions and even specific sources, e.g. Portage's USE flags.

* Motivation

Most package managers GUI sucks so bad they are less efficient than their commandline counterparts.

The commandline workflow is not ideal however:

- Search for local packages.
- Package missing?  Search for remote packages.
- List is too long: pipe through a pager.
- (Un)Install the desired package by writing the searched package names again.

With Helm all those actions get factored into one.
Helm sessions can also be resumed.

* Roadmap
** TODO Different face for dependencies.
** TODO Use long switches whenever possible.
** TODO Normalize action names.
Not "Emerge" but "Install".
Some actions are specific to some package managers however, e.g. "emerge pretend".
** TODO All actions should support multiple candidates.
Centralize commands into one `helm-system-packages-run` or something like that.
** TODO Add defcustom for commands.
To allow different command switches, e.g. the "--needed" switch in pacman.
** TODO Output to Eshell only? Comint mode?
** TODO Factor all "info" actions?
** TODO Output "info" to an Org buffer?
We probably still need specific "info" action to insert at point.
** TODO Add "find-files" command: a Helm-find-files session over the file list of the marked packages.
** TODO Add pacman support.
** Add xbps (Void Linux) support
** Add guix support
** Add homebrew support
